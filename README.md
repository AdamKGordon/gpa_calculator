Calculating your 4.0 GPA properly can inscrease your GPA by over 10%!

This calculator converts your McMaster 12 GPA to your true 4.0 GPA.

Your actual true 4.0 GPA is calculated by converting each grade to the 4.0 GPA scale and then taking the average instead of just dividing your McMaster 12 GPA by 3.
